### Data Driven Customer Segementation with K-Means Clustering ###

Marketing has a critical role when it comes to feed the company with customers that are aligned with the product or service that such company is offering. In order to do that properly it is important to understand target audience Customer Segmentation or Customer Personality Analysis is about creating different groups or segment of customers based on their behaviors. This segmentation aims to help businesses to understand their customers allowing them to:

    - Identify pain points and concerns in customers
    - Modify products and behaviors to specific needs
    - Improve marketing campaigns and targeting

Understanding customers and which segment describes them the best can help a business develop effective and efficient marketing strategies. In a dataset with few features in most cases Exploratory analysis for customer behaviour is often enough, but in a dataset that contains multiple customer attributes it becomes exponentially more difficult. K-Means Clustering algorithm which is an unsupervised learning is ideally suited for that. k-Means Clustering is frequently used algorithm for drawing insights into the formations and separations within data.
Our Goal

Goal here is to segment a dataset of E-commerce customers using k-Means Clustering Algorithm to create optimal number of Customer Segments and to classify the different customers from Online Retail.xlsx in different segments with the goal of improving marketing campaigns in the future.
